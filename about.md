I've been reading Stephen Levy's _Hackers_ over the past few weeks and just finished it up. The book provides in-depth views into the life and minds of the young nerds who would go on to shape the world of computer science. I was quite surprised to see that almost all of the great, early achievements were done with no real practical motivation; just kids making something cool and discussing it over chinese food. I like that. Funding from the Department of Defense and equipment from MIT resulting in a handful of programs that dance, sing, and play games. 

Control. The best hacks are the ones that put you in control. Create the beast and then tame it. True power and mastery. 

The book left me feeling both lousy and motivated. It's been a while since I've been able to leave my comfort zone and learn something totally new, but if some teenagers in a garage in the '70s can make history with some books and boxes of electronic scraps, then I can make something cool too. Sometimes you forget.

Levy's book has been out for 30 years now, and I'm sure hundreds, if not thousands, of others have read the book, felt the same way, and tried to go make something. Anyway, I'm one of them, so here we are.
