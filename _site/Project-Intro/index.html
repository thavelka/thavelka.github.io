I make software. I like my job very much. I get paid to sit at home
and code all day, which is exactly what I would be doing if I didn’t
have a job.

Hardware is just cooler though. Hardware hacks will always be
cooler. Nothing beats the feeling of making something you can see with
your eyes and use with your hands. It’s been a while since I’ve been
able to take on a project where I get to try something completely
new. I don’t really know anything about the hardware behind computers,
so I’m going to make one. This project will be serving as an
exploratory experience of sorts; I’ll try to keep to reading data
sheets and probing around with meters instead of following any guides
and tutorials too closely. I will surely be making a lot of mistakes
along the way, so I wouldn’t recommend copying my steps too closely
either, but feel free to follow along.

<h2 id="why-z80">Why Z80?</h2>
<p>No good reason. I didn’t know enough to choose from an engineering
standpoint, but some quick googling showed that I’ve unknowingly been
interacting with Z80s my entire life through calculators, video games,
and embedded systems everywhere. I like that. They’re still used
today, 40 years later. The name is cool. Good enough for me.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>I plan to let this project be a learning experience and nothing more,
but we’ll see how that plays out. Hooking up a keyboard, tape drive,
monitor, and modem would be very, very cool, but I’ll be thrilled if I
can get a computer I built myself to turn on and listen to a few
instructions that I toggle in with switches.</p>

<p>I have seen a few homebrew builds with backplanes, custom bus
patterns, and card-based hardware, and I like that very much. I think
that my Z80 build will end up organized like that inside a nice
enclosure eventually, but I think that would be biting off more than I
can chew at the moment. I’ll be starting the project off as a single
board computer. Getting the componenents to play nice together without
worrying about bus and power issues will enough of a challenge for
now.</p>

<p>I’d like to keep everything in the build simple and handmade. I’ll be
using some newer test equipment while learning and debugging, but
hopefully the end product will consist solely of hardware that would
have been available in the 70s and 80s. I’m going to avoid buying any
pre-fabricated boards or controllers, since that would really just be
buying a slow, outdated computer for too much money. I’m also broke as
shit.</p>

<p>I want the computer to have a name, too. I’ll be working on that.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading through Steve Ciarcia’s <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mVQnFgWzX0AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Build Your Own Z80 Computer</a></em>
repeatedly for the past week, and it’s been a godsend. Ciarcia
explains <em>why</em> as much as he explains <em>how</em>, so I don’t think I’ll
have too much trouble adapting his plans into my own designs. Donn
Stewart’s <a href="http://cpuville.com">CPUVille</a> website has also been a
source of inspiration. His schematics are simple and self-explanatory,
and his expansion boards were all functioning prototypes on perfboard
at some point, which shows that you don’t need printed circuits to
make something functional. He’s even put out a guide for getting the
Palo Alto Tiny BASIC from <em>Dr. Dobb’s</em> working on the Z80. One of the
most motivating resources I’ve found is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZb4NLXx1aM">this video</a> of Julian Ilett
hooking up a minimal Z80 setup in a matter of minutes. No RAM, no ROM,
and a 555 circuit as a clock. Shows that it’s possible to isolate
components and take things one step at a time.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>I spent a night or two scanning all of the schematics in <em>BYO Z80</em> and
getting an idea of the parts I’ll be needing to get a basic setup
running. I ordered a 6MHz CMOS Z80, 64k RAM, and a bunch of 74HC
series ICs from Mouser. In my excitement, I also drove to Fry’s the
next day to pick up a few extra chips to play around with while
waiting on the shipment, as well as a bigger breadboard and some solid
wire. I’ve never worked with ICs before, so having some extras around
can’t hurt.</p>

<p>Since I don’t really know what I’m doing yet, I decided to wait to
order a board until I knew I could fit everything on it. S100
prototype boards seem pretty expensive and hard to come by, and I’m
not sure if a single 160x100mm eurocard will be big enough. For the
next few weeks, I’ll be testing each module out on a breadboard and
moving them onto something more permanent once I know everything will
work.</p>
