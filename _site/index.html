<p>I picked up a bigger breadboard at Fry’s, along with a few logic chips to play
around with while waiting for my shipment from Mouser to come in. When I got
home and started setting things up, I realized that the only way to get 5V power
to my breadboard was through jumpers from my Arduino’s 5V and Gnd pins, which
isn’t going to work if this project is going anywhere. It was late and I
was impatient, so I decided to improvise. I keep a giant bag of old phone
chargers and USB cables stashed away just in case, and I rememebered that USB
wall chargers put out 5V, even up to 2A sometimes. I said fuck it and got to
work.</p>

<p>I make software. I like my job very much. I get paid to sit at home
and code all day, which is exactly what I would be doing if I didn’t
have a job.</p>

<p>Hardware is just cooler though. Hardware hacks will always be
cooler. Nothing beats the feeling of making something you can see with
your eyes and use with your hands. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to take on a project where I get to leave my comfort zone and learn something completely new. I
don’t really know anything about computers, so I’m going to make one. This project will be serving as a sort of exploratory experience, and I’ll be trying to stick to reading datasheets and probing around with meters rather than following any guides and tutorials too closely. I will surely be making a lot of mistakes along the way, so I wouldn’t recommend copying my steps too closely either, but feel free to follow along.</p>
