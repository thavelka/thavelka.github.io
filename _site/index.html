<p>Big progress: today I made EIGHT LEDs flash. That’s seven more than
last time. I was able to plug the Z80 in, set up the address
bus, and free run the CPU. Feels good.</p>

<p>Amazon order came in, and I think I’ve got everything I need to make
something interesting happen. Here’s what I’m working with:</p>

<p>My shipment from Mouser came in, and my desk is now covered in ICs,
resistors, LEDs, and jumpers.</p>

<p>Ciarcia’s book and other sources online start the building process off
with the clock, so I did the same. This was my first time working with
ICs, and the clock seemed like a simple and rewarding place to
start. Flashing LEDs will can make anyone feel like they’ve made
something cool.</p>

<p>I picked up a bigger breadboard at Fry’s, along with a few logic chips to play
around with while waiting for my shipment from Mouser to come in. When I got
home and started setting things up, I realized that the only way to get 5V power
to my breadboard was through jumpers from my Arduino’s 5V and Gnd pins, which
isn’t going to work if this project is going anywhere. It was late and I
was impatient, so I decided to improvise. I keep a giant bag of old phone
chargers and USB cables stashed away just in case, and I rememebered that USB
wall chargers put out 5V, even up to 2A sometimes. I said fuck it and got to
work.</p>

<p>I make software. I like my job very much. I get paid to sit at home
and code all day, which is exactly what I would be doing if I didn’t
have a job.</p>

<p>Hardware is just cooler though. Hardware hacks will always be
cooler. Nothing beats the feeling of making something you can see with
your eyes and use with your hands. It’s been a while since I’ve been
able to take on a project where I get to try something completely
new. I don’t really know anything about the hardware behind computers,
so I’m going to make one. This project will be serving as an
exploratory experience of sorts; I’ll try to keep to reading data
sheets and probing around with meters instead of following any guides
and tutorials too closely. I will surely be making a lot of mistakes
along the way, so I wouldn’t recommend copying my steps too closely
either, but feel free to follow along.</p>
