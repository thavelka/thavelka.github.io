Big progress: today I made EIGHT LEDs flash. That’s seven more than
last time. I was able to plug the Z80 in, set up the address
bus, and free run the CPU. Feels good.

<p>Big progress: today I made EIGHT LEDs flash. That’s seven more than
last time. I was able to plug the Z80 in, set up the address
bus, and free run the CPU. Feels good.

<p>In my first Mouser order, I had purchased a bunch of 74367 chips, hex
bus drivers, which Ciarcia uses to buffer the busses in the book. I
guess those lovely octal chips with data flow-through pinouts weren’t
around when the book was written. Not only did I have to use an extra
chip, but the wiring is a nightmare with the inputs and outputs all
mixed in together. Fortunately, I had purchased some 74541 octal
buffers to use elsewhere that worked perfectly for the address
bus. Way, way cleaner. I wish I had taken a picture with the hex
chips. There are so many 74-series chips out there; it’s hard to know
what you’re missing out on. I’m already getting better at digesting
the data sheets though.</p>

<p>Ciarcia’s address bus diagram:</p>

<p>Final address bus wiring:</p>

<p>The difference between flow-through pinouts and mixed input/outputs:</p>

<p>Now that I could monitor the bus, it was time to test out the Z80. I
hooked up VCC and GND, tied all data lines low to simulate a no-op,
tied WAIT, INT, NMI, and BUSRQ high, then wrote a tiny Arduino sketch
to take the place of the reset and clock circuits. I hooked LEDs up to
the lower 8 bits of the address bus, then flipped the
switch. Everything works! The lights all turned on for a second, then
dimmed and started counting up from zero. The eighth LED flickered
rapidly as I had been told, meaning the dynamic memory refresh is
working correctly.</p>

<p>Next up is the data bus. Should be similar enough, apart from the
bidirectional wiring and messy pin order on the Z80 side.</p>
