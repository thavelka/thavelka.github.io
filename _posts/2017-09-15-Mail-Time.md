Amazon order came in, and I think I’ve got everything I need to make
something interesting happen. Here’s what I’m working with:

Components from Mouser:

* 6 MHz CMOS Z80 CPU
* 64K (8k x 8) Static RAM
* 2 MHz Crystal oscillator
* A few types of 74HCXX series logic ICs
* 8 and 4 position DIP switch blocks

And some extra goods from Amazon to help with development:

* 3 Breadboards
* 2 Veroboards
* A shitload of 3mm LEDs

I really cheaped out on the breadboards and LEDs, but I'm actually
really impressed with the quality. The breadboards were "Elegoo"
brand and only about $7.99 for a three pack. That's less than the
single breadboard cost me at Fry's the other day. I was surprised to
see that they came in some really high quality packaging, and the
boards themselves were cleaner, whiter, and straighter than an altar
boy. Hell, the American-made, $8 breadboard I just bought came in a
plastic bag and looks like it's made out of recycled milk jugs.

The LEDs came in white, blue, green, red, and yellow. The leads are
sturdy, the lights are bright, and I've yet to have one fail. They
even came in a convienient labeled box. I think I paid less than $15
for 750 of them. LEDs at Fry's were something like 25 for $5.00, which
is a total rip.

I had originally considered building the computer on a 160x100mm
eurocard board, but I feared that would be much too small for a
single-board computer after drawing it out on paper. I saw that Amazon
had some larger Veroboard-branded stripboard available through Prime,
and I thought that it might be better to try to use that first, then
make some eurocard based multi-card computer system later. I'm glad I
did, too. a 10"x5" piece of stripboard sounded massive after looking
at 160x100mm eurocards all night, but I was surprised to see how small
even 10"x5" looks in person. You can see the comparison in the picture
below, with my small wireless mouse included for reference as
well. There's no way in hell I could fit everything on a single eurocard.

For now though, I'll be building everything on breadboards while I
design and experiment. I had no trouble attaching the new Elegoo
breadboards to my other one. The four boards should give me plenty of
room to work with while I'm getting started.

Now that I can fit more than just a clock circuit on the board, I
should be able to plug in the Z80 and get to work.
