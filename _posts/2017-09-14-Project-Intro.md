# 9/13/17 - Project Intro
I make software. I like my job very much, and I'm good at it. I get paid to sit at home and code all day, which is exactly what I would be doing if I didn't have a job.

Hardware is just _cooler_ though. Hardware hacking will always be cooler. Creating a beast and then taming it.

I don't really know anything about computers, so I'm going to make one. This project will be serving as a sort of exploratory experience, and I'll be trying to stick to reading datasheets and probing around with meters rather than following any tutorials too closely. I will certainly be making a lot of mistakes along the way, so you probably shouldn't follow my steps either.

## Why Z80?
I don't know enough about any microprocessors to choose from an engineering standpoint. Some quick googling showed that I've unknowingly been interacting with Z80s my entire life through calculators, video games, and embedded systems everywhere. I like that. They're still used today, 40 years later. The name is cool. Good enough for me.

## Project Goals
I plan to let this project be a learning experience and nothing more, but we'll see how that plays out. Hooking up a keyboard, tape drive, monitor, and modem would be very, very cool, but I'll be thrilled if I can get a computer I built myself to turn on and listen to a few instructions that I toggle in with switches.

I have seen a few homebrew builds with backplanes, custom bus patterns, and card-based hardware, and I like that very much. I think that my Z80 build will end up organized like that inside a nice enclosure eventually, but I think that would be biting off more than I can chew. I'll be starting the project off as a single board computer. Getting the componenents to play nice together without worrying about bus and power issues will enough of a challenge for now.

I'd like to keep everything in the build simple and handmade. I'll be using some newer test equipment while learning and debugging, but hopefully the end product will consist solely of hardware that would have been available in the 70s and 80s. I'm going to avoid buying any pre-fabricated boards or controllers, since that would really just be buying a slow, outdated computer for too much money. I'm also broke as shit.

I want the computer to have a name, too. I'll be working on that.
