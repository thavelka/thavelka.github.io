Big progress: today I made EIGHT LEDs flash. That's seven more than
last time. I was able to plug the Z80 in, set up the address
bus, and free run the CPU. Feels good.

In my first Mouser order, I had purchased a bunch of 74367 chips, hex
bus drivers, which Ciarcia uses to buffer the busses in the book. I
guess those lovely octal chips with data flow-through pinouts weren't
around when the book was written. Not only did I have to use an extra
chip, but the wiring is a nightmare with the inputs and outputs all
mixed in together. Fortunately, I had purchased some 74541 octal
buffers to use elsewhere that worked perfectly for the address
bus. Way, way cleaner. I wish I had taken a picture with the hex
chips. There are so many 74-series chips out there; it's hard to know
what you're missing out on. I'm already getting better at digesting
the data sheets though.

The difference between flow-through pinouts and mixed input/outputs:

Now that I could monitor the bus, it was time to test out the Z80. I
hooked up VCC and GND, tied all data lines low to simulate a no-op,
tied WAIT, INT, NMI, and BUSRQ high, then wrote a tiny Arduino sketch
to take the place of the reset and clock circuits. I hooked LEDs up to
the lower 8 bits of the address bus, then flipped the
switch. Everything works! The lights all turned on for a second, then
dimmed and started counting up from zero. The eighth LED flickered
rapidly as I had been told, meaning the dynamic memory refresh is
working correctly.

Next up is the data bus. Should be similar enough, apart from the
bidirectional wiring and messy pin order on the Z80 side.
